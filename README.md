# A-transformer-based-recommendation-system
This repository is for a project on 'A-Transformer-Based-Recommendation-System' by the team Data Dynamos. This project is developed as a part of an internship program provided by IIT Bombay EDTech.    
This project uses a BST model which leverages the sequential behaviour of the users in watching and rating movies, as well as user profile and movie features, to predict the rating of the user to a target movie.
